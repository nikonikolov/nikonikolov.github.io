  <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Overview</h2>
  <p class="lead">A compiler from C90 for MIPS IV architecture. Implemented in C++. The lexer is built using <a href="https://github.com/westes/flex" target="_blank">GNU Flex</a> and the parser using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/" target="_blank">GNU Bison</a>. The code for the compiler can be found at <a href="https://github.com/nikonikolov/c_compiler" target="_blank">https://github.com/nikonikolov/c_compiler</a>. The project was built as part of our coursework on Language Processors.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Outcome</h2>
    <p class="lead">One of the hardest projects I have done. Got me to have huge respect for gcc, clang and llvm.</p>

    <p class="lead">I will avoid implementation details - you can check them on GitHub. For the 2 months we had to complete the coursework (during term time), I got to fully implement lots of C features: all expressions, loops, conditionals, arrays, pointers, functions, linkabe assembly code. It was very fun playing with MIPS ABI and grammar theory. I liked the coursework a lot as it required using different complex algorithms, choosing data structures that balance between memory and speed and generating assembly.</p>
