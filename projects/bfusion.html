  <p class="lead">
  This is a research project I have been working on together with Stefan Leutenegger at the Dyson Robotics Lab at Imperial. This work is also still unpublished, so I cannot discuss it in detail.
  However, it is to come out very soon, so stay tuned. 
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
  My involvement included investigating and developing a state-of-the-art probabilistic formulation for fusing depth camera measurements and using them for SLAM and 3D reconstruction. I also helped for the development of a SLAM framework and implemented our model in it.
