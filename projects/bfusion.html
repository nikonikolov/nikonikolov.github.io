    <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Overview</h2>
    <p class="lead">
    This is a research project I worked on together with Stefan Leutenegger at the Dyson Robotics Lab at Imperial. We submitted a paper to IEEE RA-L and ICRA 2018 (paper still in review).

    <p class="lead">
    We developed a Bayesian formulation for fusing depth camera measurements in a volumetric occupancy octree grid. Our approach is particulary targeting SLAM applications and allows direct surface extraction from the octree. We prototyped efficient real-time implementation for a CPU or a CUDA-enabled GPU.
