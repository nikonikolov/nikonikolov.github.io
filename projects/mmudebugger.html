  <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Overview</h2>
  <p class="lead">This was a project I did for my summer internship at ARM Ltd in 2016. I cannot reveal too many details about implementation. The project was to build a dynamically configurable debugged to be used in the development stage of a Memory Management Unit (MMU). The debugger had to log all internal and external transactions happening inside the MMU.</p>

  <p class="lead">The debugger itself was writted in System Verilog. Having gone through compilers coursework, I could not hold myself and implemented a custom compiler that automatically produces the System Verilog code for any kind of chip. I implemented the compiler in Python. I also designed my own simplified grammar for the input language to the compiler.</p>
