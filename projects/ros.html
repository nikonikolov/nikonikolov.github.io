    <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Overview</h2>
    <p class="lead">I started this project at the time I first needed to use ROS. Being a firm supporter of Slackware Linux, I did not want to use VM since it can be very uncomfortable. Thus I decided to bring support for ROS on Slackware Linux. Currently, I am the main maintainer for ROS on Slackware. You can check the guide on the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Slackware" target="_blank">ROS wiki</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/nikonikolov/ROS-Slackware" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> with additional packages.</p>

    <p class="lead">The robot is first of its kind. I am currently writing an academic paper on the project.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">rospkg, rosdep and rosdistro for Slackware</h2>
    <p class="lead">ROS has these internal tools that it uses to determine your OS distro in order to check for and install dependencies automatically. They are all implemented in python, so I just needed to write implementation of these tools for Slackware. The hardest part was finding a proper documentation as at some point I had read through a large part of the code to understand how it works.</p>

    <p class="lead">The next part was less fun as I needed to define all Slackware software packages that ROS depends on. This required some more time and research but I finally got there. It was kind of interesting since I learned more about the packages that exist out there.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">SlackBuilds</h2>
    <p class="lead">Unfortunately some of the dependencies did not have Slackware packages, so I had to create them. Of course one can always install from source, but this is not always robust and is not the Slackware way. I ended up creating Slackware packages for <a href="https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/libraries/pcl/" target="_blank">pcl</a>, <a href="https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/libraries/gazebo/" target="_blank">gazebo</a>, <a href="https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/libraries/ignition-math2/" target="_blank">ignition-math2</a>, <a href="https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/libraries/ignition-transport/" target="_blank">ignition-transport</a>, <a href="https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/academic/flann/" target="_blank">flann</a>, <a href="https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/libraries/console_bridge/" target="_blank">console_bridge</a>, <a href="https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/libraries/urdfdom/" target="_blank">urdfdom</a>. It was not straightforward as I ran into some runtime errors due to incorrect configuration, linking problems and writing patches. It was fun as I made contribution to Slackware too and got much better at cmake and scripting.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Building ROS</h2>
    <p class="lead">Lastly I had to build ROS. This was not straightforward either since Slackware manages its OS packages differently and this required its fair share of little cmake patches to fix linking errors. I also got to discover a bug on x86_64 architectures in the ROS build system that is currently beign fixed.</p>
