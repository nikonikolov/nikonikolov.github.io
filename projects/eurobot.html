    <p class="lead">
    <a href="http://www.eurobot.org/" target="_blank">Eurobot</a> is an international amateur robotics contest open to teams of students. In 2017, I was part of the Imperial College team. The goal was to make the robot build a lunar base fully autonomously in 90 seconds.

    <p class="lead">
    I worked on designing all of the robot subsystems and oversaw the whole development of the robot. I also actively contributed to the localization algorithm.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Software</h2>
    <p class="lead">We have so far chosen a Raspberry Pi 3 as our main processor. For low level tasks and interfaces we are going to use mbeds that are connected to the Pi. We are currently finalizing our localization system which is based on custom-built sonar-based beacons. On the robot we have a ring of sonars which detect the pulses sent by the beacons. We also use odometry and Kalman filter to improve our estimation. We are going to use ROS as it provides easy to use communication procedures, configurable protocols and a lot of useful robotics packages. I am currently teaching a small ROS course to the team in order to get them on track.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Electronics</h2>
    <p class="lead">Currently our biggest problems are in this area since. We have set a goal to make the robot move very fast. For this reason we decided to use brushless motors. Luckily a former ICRS (Imperial College Robotics Society) member has developed <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/11583-odrive-high-performance-motor-control">ODrive</a> - a way to precisely control DC brushless motors using encoders. The bad news are that it cannot be done in real time so we are now extending the system to support communication over Serial USB. We will also need to do so PID control calibration afterwards.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Mechanics</h2>
    <p class="lead">We are currently building a prototype of a mechanism to grasp and drop lunar modules. We are also trying to store several lunar modules in our robot to save some time. It is kind of a complex system since the hand we are using needs to be very fast and able to rotate. Moreover as we need to place the lunar modules oriented with our team colour on top, the mechanism needs to be able to rotate the modules after they have been placed inside the robot. Will post some photos when we finalize it.</p>

    <p class="lead">In parallel we are developing an omni-wheel base. We have decided to go for omni-wheel as it saves navigation time and is accurate enough. Hopefully this will win us more points at the competition</p>
