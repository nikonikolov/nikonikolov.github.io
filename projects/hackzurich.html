    <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Overview</h2>
    <p class="lead">This project was built during <a href="http://hackzurich.com/" target="_blank">HackZurich</a> in September 2016. There was no official challenge for the hackathon and since we were a team of people interested in robotics, we decided to build computer vision related project. Our idea was to provide real-time fridge contents information. We decided that putting a lot of cameras in a fridge is expensive and inefficient so we tackled the problem by making people take pictures of their grocery receipts and analyzing that information. Tracking what leaves the fridge was responsiblity of the user to log in our mobile app. Admittedly, this is not the most convenient way, but we cared more about the receipts because they were far more interesting from a technical point of view (and surprisingly difficult to process).</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">Implementation</h2>

    <p class="lead">We wanted to go hard and make sure we can process any kind of receipt. This turned out to be very difficult because different stores have so many various receipt formats. Another problem was processing receipts which were photographed tilted or upside down. The latter problem we solved by using some maths and Fourier Transforms in order to detect the direction of the receipt and rotate it.</p>

    <p class="lead">Next, given a properly oriented receipt, we fed it to Google OCR API. It gave pretty good results. Now given the text on the receipt, we had to make sense of it (compilers flashback). We ended up using some complex custom parsing algorithm. Of course a grocery database would have been very helpful, but who can build one in a weekend. Moreover, the OCR API sometimes screwed up.</p>

    <p class="lead">There was a guy on our team who was more interested in front end, so he built an app for the user using React.</p>

    <p class="lead">I enjoyed working on this project a lot. It turned out to be sth much more complex than it seemed at first, but we proved the idea is possible by building a prototype.</p>
