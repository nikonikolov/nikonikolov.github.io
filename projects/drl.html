    <p class="lead">
    I built this project during a 10-week internship at <a href="http://ocadotechnology.com/" target="_blank">Ocado Technology</a> in summer 2017. I implemented an algorithm for a robotic arm to pick objects from a basket based on uncalibrated camera input. The approach was primarily based on the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02199" target="_blank">[1] Sergey Levine, Peter Pastor, Alex Krizhevsky, and Deirdre Quillen. Learning hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping with deep learning and large-scale data collection. CoRR, abs/1603.02199, 2016</a>. The implementation I wrote is in TensorFlow. For picking, I used a suction cup system developed by Ocado Technology. I deployed the algorithm on a <a href="https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur10-robot/" target="_blank">UR10 robotic arm</a>.
