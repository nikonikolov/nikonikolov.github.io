  <p class="lead">
  This is the project I am working on during my internship at <a href="http://ocadotechnology.com/" target="_blank">Ocado Technology</a>. I am working in the Robotics Research Team for 10 weeks. I am investigating applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning for grasping. I also spent some time doing Deep Learning with tensorflow for object recognition from images. This is ongoing and unpublished work, so I cannot discuss it yet. Stay tuned.
