  <p class="lead">This was again coursework project for my Computer Architecture module. The first part was implementing a simulator for MIPS I Architeture CPU instruction set. The simulator was implemented in C++ and ran on a x86_64 Linux system. It was fed series of instruction sets that it executed. It also supported memory interfacing. Additionally, I wrote a test suite for ensuring correct operation. You can find my code on <a href="https://github.com/nikonikolov/MIPS_Simulator" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <p class="lead">Second part of the coursework was building a dynamically configurable cache simulator that adopts Least Recently Used policy. It supported both Direct Mapped and Set Associative configurations. The implementation also simulated waiting times. Again written in C++. You can find my code on <a href="https://github.com/nikonikolov/cache-simulator" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
