    <p class="lead">
    The goal of this project is to build a drone that is able to deliver food around Brown University, Providence, RI. I am working together with Aaron Zhang - a student at Brown. We are developing a special mechanism that allows for faster and more secure deliveries. We are using a DJI M-100 as a development platform, but our mechanism can be deployed on any other drone. The project is named A2Z drone delivery.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    With our mechanism, the package is lowered on a tether and the drone does not need to land. The package can fall down freely (similar to a fishing rod) and stop right before it hits the ground. This has numerous advantages, such as substantially decreased delivery time, stronger drone stability, safety (unfriendly people cannot hold the tether and prevent the drone from flying off as the tether can be released by the drone).

    <h2 class="featurette-heading text-muted">First Prototype</h2>
    <p class="lead">The type of control that DJI M-100 provides is accomplished by serial connection and a specific protocol implemented by DJI. It allows for an onboard embedded system to connect to the autopilot and send commands such as waypoint navigation.</p>

    <p class="lead">My choice of onboard embedded system was a Raspberry Pi 3 since the DJI SDK currently requires a thread-safe operating system to run on and linux seems like the best choice. For our first prototype we are going to use the Pi to partially navigate the drone using the SDK and on a given signal by the remote control of the DJI, activate a mechanism that drops the package. We are planning to automate this in the future, but for now we are going for the "minimum viable product" concept. </p>

    <p class="lead">Our delivery mechanism is spool based and is managed by servo motors. Luckily, my <a href="https://github.com/nikonikolov/libdnx">libdnx</a> library (the same one I wrote for the <a href="/portfolio/wkquad.html">Walking Quad</a>) supports Raspberry Pi so I chose the same servos. I also had to simplify the electronics system as much as possible as my friend is setting everything up and it is really hard to make everything work from distance.</p>
