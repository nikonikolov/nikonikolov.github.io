			<h3>Tips</h3>

			<p class="gen_about_paragraph">First of all, do note that this page is not to be considered as a conclusive guide for applying to US universities. The purpose of the information below is to share the experience of previous candidates(both successful and not) and give a brief overview of the application process. We do not guarantee that following the listed tips will get you an acceptance.
			<br><br>
			The most important piece of advice when applying to US universities is to START PREPARING EARLY. Normally the right time would be eight or ninth grade. If you are late, do not worry, the fight is not lost. There are a lot of pitfalls in creating a successful application, so we encourage you to try to gain as much information as possible yourself. There are also other web and book resources than this one. A good starting point would be to connect to successful applicants from previous years and to the Fulbright Center in Sofia. The application can be divided into several stages, which are briefly covered below. Please pay special attention to the Extra Flair section. We still encourage you to assemble more information yourself and definitely check the requirements of the specific universities way before you start preparing your application. Lastly, during your journey, try to remember that the hill can sometimes look too far away, but the view is better from the top.

			<h3>School Record</h3>

			<p class="gen_about_paragraph">Your school background and environment is one of the most important pieces of information. You can generally expect that the admissions office will be familiar with the educational system in your country: most probably there have been multiple other candidates who had applied before you. There might even be a specific person from the admissions office who is responsible for evaluating applications from your region every year. 
			<br><br>
			Your school transcript serves as an indication of how you perform in academic environment. Needless to say, you are expected to have the best marks possible. Do not worry if you do not, there are other parts in the application where you can shine with your accomplishments, just make sure your performance is excellent in the subject areas related to your major and your overall mark is really close to the maximum.
			<br><br>
			The important part here is your school. Generally, the universities will prefer to admit students from schools they already know and keep good track of. An important thing to note, is that if you study at an American-type school or at the United World Colleges, your chances will be substantially improved. If your school is not part of this list, this does not at all mean that you will get rejected, only that your chances of getting accepted are slightly lowered (we are again speaking from experience). Nevertheless, you might be eligible for spending some time at an American school on an exchange program. Check again the Study Abroad Section.

			<h3>Exams</h3>

			<p class="gen_about_paragraph exam_paragraph">These most often include the following:</p> 

			<ul>
				<li class="exams">SAT Reasoning Test</li>
					<p class="gen_about_paragraph exam_paragraph">The hardest one of these is the SAT Reasoning Test. You should as always start preparing early and do check what exam dates are available at your nearest test center. Note that in long term, the best preparation for this test is READING CLASSICAL AMERICAN LITERATURE from 18th, 19th and 20th century. This will include at least 2 or 3 books. Remember that a really good SAT result can bring you extra points. In short term, you can best prepare by solving a lot of sample tests in EXAM CONDITIONS. We DO recommend buying the official SAT exam book from CollegeBoard. An outstanding result will generally be anything above 2300. Usually if you score more than 2150 you should not worry, but remember test scores alone do not mean much if they are not reinforced by a strong application.</p> 
				<li class="exams">SAT Subject Tests</li>
					<p class="gen_about_paragraph exam_paragraph">These should not be hard for a bright mind like you and you should definitely try to score the maximum. Barrons' exam books for the specific test should be a good preparation resource. Note there is usually some material that is taught in 11th and 12th grades in Bulgarian Schools. This should not stop you from taking the test earlier than that and still scoring the maximum. Again, DO a lot of sample tests!  
				<li class="exams">TOEFL/IELTS</li>
					<p class="gen_about_paragraph exam_paragraph">After taking the SAT Reasoning Test, this should feel like a piece of cake. You do not necessarily need a really high result on this test - universities require it as an evidence you can speak English. A score higher than 105 would usually be all you need.
			</ul>

			<p class="gen_about_paragraph exam_paragraph"><br>Although the above may sound easy, you should definitely take your time to study properly. You can often find yourself spending weeks preparing only for a single exam. Note as well the reference scores provided above are not at all conclusive and might vary accross universities. For details, check the Tests/Exams section on the target university's website. Do not forget you should usually register for a test approximately a month before it takes place</p>

			<h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>

			<p class="gen_about_paragraph">These can include various activities: from Sports to Volunteering Activities to Playing Musical Instruments. Not being involved with any kind of extracurricular activities will bring you a lot of negative points. It really does not matter what type of activity you prefer. The committee wants to know whether you are seriously involved with it rather than starting it just for the benefits of your application. Quantity rarely outweighs quality here. You are usually busy preparing for tests, performing well at school and winning competitions: you do not have time to fully commit to numerious activities. Two or three will often be the optimal number. 

			It is a much better exibition of leadership if you start a club or society on your own. The Bulgarian education system does not imply the existence of student-run school societies by default, so there is big room for new accomplishments. You are probably one of the best techies in your school, why do not you start a robotics or hacking club? Arm your creativity and just do it.  
			</p>

		<div class="gen_sub_block">
			
			<h3>Extra Flair</h3>

			<p class="gen_about_paragraph">Probably the MOST IMPORTANT piece of your application. Remember that most of the other applicant will also have excellent test results and school records. This section can help you shine by showing your accomplishments in your field of study. These will usually include International Competitions and Olympiads, some of which are listed in the Competitions section on our website. Note that a single medal at International Olympiad might not mean a lot (we might be wrong here: we are speaking from personal experience but there have been occassional cases that have proven this statement wrong). Generally, you will be expected to show a good track of accomplishments at International Level and it will be marvellous if you can show accomplishements in more than one field - this will really make you stick out. This is hardly achieved overnight and requires a lot of persistence and studying. However, it remains one of the most important parts of your application. 

			On a separate note: to be allowed to partricipate in International Olympiads you are expected to be in top few at the respective National Olympiad. For more information and possibly preparation ask your school teacher. You should be also able to find the information you need on Google. Now go to the Subjects section on our website and start studying.

			<h3>Essays</h3>

			<p class="gen_about_paragraph">This is the most personal part of your application. Remember that most of the other applcants will also have outstanding school records and exam results as well as similar extracurricular activities and achievements in your subject field. The essay is your opportunity to show them why they should accept you rather than the other candidates, what difference did you make in your community and your initiatives. It is the piece where you can show them who you really are and connect all the pieces of your application together (do not take this literally). Generally, the admissions office wants get to know you better and understand how you think. 
			<br><br>
			A scientific approach to writing a good essays hardly exists. The best advice is to start writing as early as possible (generally 2-3 months before the deadline is a good starting point). During the writing process try to get feedback from various successful candidates: it is important to see different viewpoints as this is most probably going to be the case with the admissions committee as well. It is not excluded that you end up completely changing the topic of your essay. There are definitely other resources which give better perspective of the art of writing a college application essay than this one. Probably one of the best is the book <i>"On Writing The College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance at the College of Your Choice"</i> by Harry Bauld who is a former admissions officer at several Ivy League universities. Depending on your writing preferences, you can also read other's candidates essays, both successful and not, to get an idea of what a successful essay should look like. One really good resource is <a href="https://www.apstudynotes.org/essays/">this website</a>.</p>

			<h3>Financial Aid</h3>

			<p class="gen_about_paragraph">Plase note the difference between Financial Aid and Merit-based Scholarships: the fortmer is solely based on your parents income while the latter is based on your academic achievements. Almost all financial awards of the above universities are financial-aid-based. International students are most often eligible to apply and the award will usually cover all your expenses or an amount close to that. Awards and policies vary accross different institutions so DO CHECK the information provided at each university's website.

			Keep in mind that your financial application is most often considered when the committee is making its final decision. The question how much your family contribution should be has no unambiguous answer. However, you or your parents should definitely try to contribute some amount towards the final cost; the opposite case can make the committee think that you do not consider your education important (remember that in America some families save during their whole lives to send their children to college).</p>
